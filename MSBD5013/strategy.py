#     Notes:
#     1. All data else you need in your model and strategy should be stored by yourself in

#     2. Return value are limited to be in the following form: position_matrix_of_next_minute,
#     memory_list
#
#     3. Backtest module will accept return values from your strategy function and use them as
#     new input into your strateg function in next minute.
#
#     4. Strategy functions that cannot operate properly in back test may ower your final grade.
#     Please double check to make sure that your strategy function satisfy all the requirments above.
